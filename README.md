# command-powershell

This repository contains color coding for standard Windows 10 command prompt 
and registry keys for the context menu to open command prompt or PowerShell
in the directory the context menu was opened (with Shift + right click).

Heavily inspired by c't magazine and adapted to my personal needs.
